# Anime-Quote-Webpage
This webpage displays a random anime quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The quote is fetched from the Animechan API using a JavaScript `fetch()` request. The webpage includes an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file that work together to create a functional and visually appealing user interface.

# Getting Started
To use the Anime Quote Webpage, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Usage
To fetch a new quote, simply click the "New Quote" button. The webpage will make a `fetch()` request to the Animechan API and display a new quote in the quote container.
